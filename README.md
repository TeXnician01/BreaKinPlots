1. Download the program "BreaKinPlots#.py" ("#" is the version number, e.g. "2") and the corresponding "BreaKinPlots-config.txt"
2. Place these two files in a folder of your choice. Note that the files need to be moved together, if moved at all. I recommend placing them above the data you want to analyze.
3. Configure the file "BreaKinPlots-config.txt". Instructions are given in the file.
4. Configure the input files "input_files" and "input_peaks" in the experiment folder (e.g. BreaKinPlots_Demo/FKD099_347-). Instructions are given in the files.
5. Run the Python program in a terminal/console of your choice by typing "python BreaKinPlots#.py" ("#" is the version number, e.g. "2") and hit the "Enter" key
